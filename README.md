# Cozy Bird 🦉
*A Flappy Bird–style experimental project built with performance and clarity in mind.*

## Overview  
**Cozy Bird** is a long-term experimental project where I explore advanced implementation techniques, performance optimization, and clean coding practices—all while keeping the classic Flappy Bird gameplay loop fun and simple.

## Implemented Features  

### 🎮 Gameplay  
- Core mechanics: flap (jump), gravity, and collision detection.  

### ⚙️ Architecture & Systems  
- **Finite State Machine (FSM):** Manages overall game states in the main scene.  
- **Object Pooling:** Optimizes performance by reusing pillar (pipe) instances.  
- **Audio Manager:** Centralized control of sound effects (and background music planned for later).  

### 🧰 Technologies & Tools  
- **Godot Engine:** Game development framework.  
- **Pixelorama:** Used for creating pixel art sprites.  
- **Audacity:** For editing, and mixing audio assets.  
- **Git & GitHub:** Version control and collaboration.  

## Notes  
This project is both a playground for experimentation and a learning ground for better software design, optimization, and creativity.
