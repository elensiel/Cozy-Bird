# Cozy Bird: A Flappy Bird clone
This will be a long term experimental project of mine where I will try to stretch out complex implementation to further improve performance, apply cleaner coding practices, and just to have fun with it.

## Implemented Features
### Gameplay
- Basic mechanics: jump (or flap in which I called it here), gravity, collisions.
### Architecture and Systems
- Finite State Machine: Controls game state in the main game scene.
- Object Pooling: For performance optimization of pipe (or pillar as I call it) spawning.
- Audio Manager: Centralized control of sfx (and music hopefully in the future).
### Technologies & Tools
- Godot: Game engine for the development.
- Pixelorama: Software used for creating the sprites
- FL Studio: The DAW used for producing and mixing audio related assets.
- Git & Github: Version Control of the project.
